# Airgead Banking Investment Calculator

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a class assignment for CS-210 to demonstrate the mastery of designing functional programs that comply with industry regulations and best practices.

## Scenario

As a junior developer at Chada Tech, I was tasked with collaborating with Airgead Banking to develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. The application focuses on investing and the power of compound interest.

## Functional Requirements

The application meets the following functional requirements:
- Allows users to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years for the investment.
- Calculates and displays the investment growth without monthly deposits.
- Calculates and displays the investment growth with monthly deposits.
- Displays the results in a tabular format showing the year, year-end balance, and year-end earned interest.
- Prompts the user to restart the program with different values.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- `main.cpp`: The main entry point of the application.
- `InvestmentCalculator.cpp`: Implementation of the `InvestmentCalculator` class.
- `InvestmentCalculator.h`: Header file defining the `InvestmentCalculator` class.
- `.vscode/launch.json`: Configuration for launching the application in Visual Studio Code.
- `.vscode/settings.json`: Settings for file associations in Visual Studio Code.
- `.vscode/tasks.json`: Tasks for building the application in Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

1. Run the application.
2. Enter the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years for the investment when prompted.
3. View the calculated investment growth without monthly deposits.
4. View the calculated investment growth with monthly deposits.
5. Choose whether to restart the program with different values.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the ability to design and implement a functional C++ application that meets specified requirements and follows best practices. The Airgead Banking Investment Calculator serves as an educational tool to help students understand the importance of investing and compound interest.
